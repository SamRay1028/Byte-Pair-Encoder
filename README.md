# Byte-Pair-Encoder

This program is a work in progress.

THis code program is a byte pair encoder, which tokenizes text for the purposes of machine learning. Currently, the training process, whereby the program creates a vocabulary is complete; however, the ability to apply this vocabulary for the tokenization of new texts is currently being worked on.
